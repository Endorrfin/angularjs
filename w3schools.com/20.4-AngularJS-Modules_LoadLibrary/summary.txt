AngularJS Modules
An AngularJS module defines an application.

The module is a container for the different parts of an application.

The module is a container for the application controllers.

Controllers always belong to a module.

Creating a Module
A module is created by using the AngularJS function angular.module




Adding a Directive
AngularJS has a set of built-in directives which you can use to add functionality to your application.

For a full reference, visit our AngularJS directive reference.

In addition you can use the module to add your own directives to your applications:




Functions can Pollute the Global Namespace
Global functions should be avoided in JavaScript. They can easily be overwritten or destroyed by other scripts.

AngularJS modules reduces this problem, by keeping all functions local to the module.

When to Load the Library
While it is common in HTML applications to place scripts at the end of the <body> element, it is recommended that you load the AngularJS library either in the <head> or at the start of the <body>.

This is because calls to angular.module can only be compiled after the library has been loaded.
